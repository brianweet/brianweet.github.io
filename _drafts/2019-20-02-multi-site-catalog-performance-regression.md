Last week I helped tracking down a performance issue in one of our projects. The project is quite interesting, it's a multi-site architecture and offers commerce for both B2B and B2C customers in various markets. We're using multiple product catalogs, with some products existing in only one of the catalogs while other products are available in multiple catalogs.

For a while the overall performance was getting worse, which often happens as you start importing the content and catalog items and the size of your solution grows. As we're hosting on Azure, we could see that at times it even recycled the app pool, usually due to memory constraints. Once we had representable size catalog, the performance issues were really apparent, especially on category pages. On these pages we rely on [Episerver Find](https://www.episerver.com/products/platform/episerver-find/) in order to search and filter through our catalog data, offering a list of products and various options for filtering and sorting. The catalog has a moderate size, totaling up to around 260k items in the index, a number Episerver Find can easily handle.

A [colleague](http://marisks.net/) noticed something weird: "*In smaller categories, it works pretty fast. In larger categories, it fails.*". The fact that category size affects performance to the point that it **fails** is very strange, it shouldn't even affect the performance of the page that much at all. Therefore he verified our find queries but to no avail "*I checked the code and it was loading only one page at a time. Not sure how category size affects it.*"

I was asked if I could to dig into this problem and figure out what was happening. Using Application Insights [Live Metrics Stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/live-stream) I noticed we were doing a couple of hundred database queries per second, with spikes up to 2k, without a heavy user load. Profiling locally I noticed the same. It seemed to happen on every page load and the amount of queries was quite insane.

### The problem and the plan

We need a game plan, let's write down some observations:

- Find index should be able to handle this easily
- We do retrieve paginated content, but category size seems to affect page performance
- Reloading the category page is slow
  - Are we doing heavy calculations?
  - Page performance doesn't seem to improve, is the content we use being cached?

Quite often we rely heavily on the fact that content is being [cached](https://world.episerver.com/documentation/developer-guides/CMS/caching/) by Episerver. Often, on pages like category pages, you might not want to rely on the caching of all content items. If you use Epi Find, you can choose to add additional data to the Find index and retrieve it directly from the index using [projections](https://world.episerver.com/documentation/developer-guides/find/NET-Client-API/searching/Projections/). This way you will not have to load the content item itself, but use the data from the index. The first thing I did was remove some code which still relies quite heavy on cached content, however it did not seem to impact the performance that much. One thing that struck me was that removing URLs from our ViewModel seemed to have a big impact... ðŸ¤”

### Visual Studio CPU profiling to the rescue

As my previous blog about a [memory leak]({% post_url 2019-11-01-finding-memory-leak-epi-on-azure %}), I was quite lucky this time as well. Even though I must say I was quite confused when I ran the CPU profiler, it was not that hard to get to the root of the problem. The screenshot shows the CPU time for loading a category page with 1200 products, displaying only 40 products, with around 5 variations each. As you can see it took almost 6 seconds of CPU time!

As mentioned, the solution I was looking at has multiple sites, but more importantly, it has multiple catalogs as well. The structure of these catalogs is different and catalog content can be linked to multiple categories. By default Episerver only supports generating the url for the primary category, fortunately there's a nice blogpost on Episerver world by Magnus Rahl about creating a [context aware router](https://world.episerver.com/blogs/Magnus-Rahl/Dates/2015/3/routing-context-aware-links-in-commerce-catalog/) which seemed to work for our use case as well.

If you look at the screenshot above, it turns out that 88% of the CPU time was spent in the GetVirtualPath method of the catalog content router, which is used to generate URLs for catalog content (for example URL to product detail page). A bit further down the line we see that most of the time is spent in `DefaultContentLoader.GetChildren` (dare to guess where the db load was coming from?).

Our categories are quite big, when I inspected the code below it turned out we had 5k+ children for one single category.

```csharp
if (!contentLoader.GetChildren<CatalogContentBase>(preferredParent)
    .Any(c => c.ContentLink.CompareToIgnoreWorkID(content.ContentLink)))
{
    return base.GetPartialVirtualPath(content, language, routeValues, requestContext);
}
```

Reading the blog post again I found the reason for this check: "But other than that the logic is simple: If there's a preferred parent supplied, see if the routed content is actually a child of that content and in that case create a URL based on that parent instead."

In our case I decided to remove the check, but another option would be to verify that the content actually has the preferredParent as a parent. As I think that you usually have just a few parents:
```csharp
// WARNING: untested
// Using find extension method to get parents
var parents = content.ParentNodeRelations();
if (!parents.Any(x => x.Equals(preferredParent)))
{
    return base.GetPartialVirtualPath(content, language, routeValues, requestContext);
}
```

This one check proved to be the main cause of our problems, after removing it our category page loads <1s again.
