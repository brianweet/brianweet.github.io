In this series of posts I will write about the IoT academy workshop. 

The day started with a presentation of Niels Stamhuis from the IoT Academy. The presentation covered the vision of the IoT academy, their goals and what they do for and with their partners. 
The presentation started with explaining IoT in general, LoRa, the Lora frequencies, spread spectrum communication, the KPN LoRa network and the Lora Alliance.
The different device classes A, B and C were covered, explaining the different cases for using different class devices.
Encryption was covered, explaining message end-to-end encryption. 

Jan van Loenen from SoDaQ took over with a presentation about the LoRa Workshop. He showed us the SoDaQ Autonomo Arduino board, which offers a LoRa chip, connectors for a LiPo battery and a solar power panel. He showed us the SoDaQ one (not LoRa TM One) and energy calculations based on different spread factors. Interesting to see that the difference between SF7 and SF12 was 1500 days ~ 50 days.
The Workshop will start by testing the SoDaQ boards with a nice blink application. 
Today we're able to use the KPN LoRa test gateway for one day. They brought a gateway them and unfortunately will take the gateway with them after this workshop.
   
There are no test gateways close to our office.

Then we will register our device on the KPN test environment.
