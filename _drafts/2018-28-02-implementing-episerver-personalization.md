A couple of weeks ago my colleague [Maris](http://marisks.net/) implemented Episerver Perform / Personalization for one of our customers. As I was looking into performance of the site I noticed a performance regression and started looking into what might have caused it.

# Personalization explained
What did we implement. Clean and simple

# Performance regressions
Show graphs, avg slowdown

# Different approach

- Rel next prev
- Clean trash job
- Add custom property address
